            <para>With the linear (One-dimensional) barcode extension it is possible to create bar
                codes using all the commonly accepted symbologies. The resulting bar code can be
                created as either an image (in PNG or JPEG format) or as a Postscript file ready for
                printing on high resolution printers. </para>
            <para>The bar code extension provides extensive data verification which makes sure that
                the created barcode follows the official applicable standards.</para>
            <para>
                <note>
                    <para>All generated bar codes (except CODE 11 which have little support in
                        Europe) have been extensively verified using Metrologic CCD-47 handhold
                        scanner. </para>

            <para>In order to create a linear barcode the module
                    "<filename>jpgraph_barcode.php</filename>" must be included.</para>
            <para>There are several types of linear barcode even though they all use the same
                principle. The reason for several different types (or symbologies as it is known) is
                partly to handle different requirements (for example encoding just numerical data or
                both numerical and alphabetical data) and partly because they were initially created
                by different companies to solve similar problems. The library supports most of the
                common linear barcode. These types of barcode look like what can be usually seen on
                consumer goods.</para>
            <para>The different types of barcodes are often referred to as different
                symbologies.</para>
            <para>Most of the commonly used symbologies has been elevated to ISO/IEC standards. Some
                barcode which have not yet been accepted as ISO standard are available from AIM
                    (<uri xlink:href="http://www.aimglobal.org">http://www.aimglobal.org</uri>). In
                USA the organization responsible for issuing retail codes used in barcodes are the
                    <emphasis role="italic">Uniform Code Council</emphasis>, (UCC) <uri
                    xlink:href="http://www.uc-council.org/">http://www.uc-council.org</uri>.</para>
            <para>While these standards are very comprehensive they are of little interest to end
                user of the barcode. For an end user the three most important question when
                selecting a barcode symbology are</para>

                            a given input data string? </para>
                        <para>Linear barcodes typically encode alphanumerical strings up to maximum
                            of ~20 characters. </para>

                                <para>While many of the barcode symbologies can handle, in theory
                                    unlimited, string lengths there are practical limitation to how
                                    wide barcode a given reader/scanner can interpret. Most handhold
                                    scanners can usually not reliable read a barcode wider than
                                    ~10cm.</para>

                        <para>How strong is the tolerance against physical damage, i.e. how large

                            scanner?</para>
                        <para>The tolerance for linear barcode are in general low. If one ore more
                            of the bars (making up the barcode) is unreadable the whole barcode is
                            in practice unreadable. While some barcode symbologies include a check
                            digit this is not enough to re-create damaged data. It is only enough to
                            verify with some confidence that the data is intact, however there is
                            still no guarantee since two errors might, by coincidence, make the
                            check digit correct. </para>
                        <para>A common way to strengthen linear barcodes is to make them physically
                            larger/taller.</para>

                </orderedlist>While linear barcodes is still widely used in legacy applications
                there are almost no new applications that uses linear barcode due in part to the
                limitations listed above (poor fault tolerance and low capacity). Most new
                applications uses either RFID tags or two dimensional barcodes (described in the
                following chapters) which have much higher data capacity and fault tolerance.</para>

            <title>How does linear barcodes work?</title>
            <para>Linear barcodes are created by translating the supported characters that should be
                displayed into combination of narrow and wide bars which are combined into a
                barcode. To identify the start and end of a barcode special "guard" patterns are
                used to indicate to the scanner that the barcode starts and also identify what type
                of symbology is used.</para>
            <para>To illustrate this <xref xlink:href="#fig.explaining-barcode"/> shows an enlarged
                and amended barcode thats uses the Code 25 symbology and encodes the numeric string
                "123". In order to illustrate the different parts we have colored the start and stop
                pattern and the three digits to make it clear how it is encoded.</para>

            </para>
            <para>We have chosen to illustrate the principle with the code 25 symbology since it is
                easy to understand. Each character is encoded with 5 black elements with spaces in
                between, 2 wide and three narrow elements, hence the name 2 of 5 (or 25). The width
                of the thinnest element is also known as the module width. Other symbologies have
                more complicated patterns to achieve higher density (more encoded characters in a
                given width) but the principle still stands.</para>
            <para>The typical scanner sends out light which is reflected and is them measured as the
                scanner swipes from left to right. The relative size of the black and white areas
                are measured and translated back to a the encoded data.</para>
            <para>The human readable string, usually at the bottom of the barcode is strictly
                speaking not a part of the barcode. It is only there to help a human reader
                interpret the barcode.</para>
            <para>Some barcode symbologies also add a check digit at the end of the data. This check
                digit (or digits) is used to verify that the interpretated data has been read
                correctly.</para>

                    is fairly efficient in terms of space/datasize ratio.</para>

                    <para>The term "symbology" is the term used to describe the combination of
                        encodation method (how characters are translated to bars) and the layout of
                        the bars specified by a particular barcode standard. All of the listed
                        standard symbologies above are still widely used. Many of the symbologies
                        overlap in terms of functionality and multiple symbologies might be possible
                        to use for a particular application unless there is a strict standard that
                        stipulates that a particular symbology should be used. </para>
                    <para>The reason for the existence of so many symbologies with overlapping
                        functionality is in some cases the result of different companies early on
                        specifying there own patented barcodes in order to gain market shares or in
                        some cases lock customers to a specific brand of scanner. In other cases it
                        is simply the result of that earlier barcodes could not handle new
                        demands.</para>
