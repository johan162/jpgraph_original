PHP5: JpGraph 3.0.0p Professional Version Released
==================================================

JpGraph 3.0.0p is now available for immediate download.

This is a major update that among other improvements addresses the following:

 * A completely rewritten documentation. The new documentation covers
   all aspects of the library in a coherent format. This new documentation is also
   available on-line at 
   
        http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/docportal/index.html

 * More than 30 feature requests has been implemented and released. Among them are
 
     * Support for 2D Matrix visualization
     * Support for 2D Contour graphs
     * Support for QR-Codes which is the highest capacity 2D-Barcode available
     * A new command line utility to generate linear barcodes
     * Rewritten error handling to fully support (and use) PHP5 exception handling
     * Support of Gantt bars with discontinuities
     * Support for PHP 5.3
     * ... and many more. Full details are available on the download page


Upgrade policy:
===============

As stated in the license each license covers one major version of the library.

However, we have decided that all customers who have purchased a license
this year ,i.e. after 2009-01-01 will be entitled to a free upgrade. 
For those who have purchased a license prior to 2008-12-31 a discounted license 
upgrade is available.

For those not interested in the new features of v3.0.0 it is still possible
to benefit from the new documentation since that is also available in the
2.4.1p release which is freely available.

Potential issues upgrading from 2.4.x
======================================

* From a functional point of view there are no API breaks in 3.0.0. 

* There are some restructuring of where files are located in the library
  which means that scripts using PDf417 or Datamatrix must update the
  paths from where the individual library files are read from.

* In addition all methods that were marked as "Deprecated" (and gave an
  error when the define "ERR_DEPRECATED" was enabled) have been removed.

* The default paths for TTF fonts for Linux/Unix has been updated to follow
  the standard base recommendation.
  
* All files are now using UTF-8 character encoding. This should only help and not 
  be of any consequence as we can foresee


Phase out of 2.4.x branch
==========================

The 2.4.x branch will be phased out within the coming 6 months and only critical
errors will be corrected. No new features will be included (unless this comes
for free when correcting a critical defect).


NuSphere Encoder
================

One new feature to further increase the performance of this release of
the library is that both branches include versions of the 
library that have been encoded with the NuSphere encoder. 
(See http://www.nusphere.com) in a separate directory "PHPExpress-src/"

When these versions are used with a server that have the (free) PHPExpress
module installed this will greatly increase the performance of the library
since the PHP server will not have to do any parsing and translation to
bytecode for each script that is run. Depending on the application and
how frequent the call to the graph scripts are made it is not unreasonable
to expect well over 50% decrease in execution time for the graph code
itself. Of course, if there are complicated SQL statements populating the 
graphs the overall increase might not be as much.

You can freely download the PHPExpress module from NuSphere homepage.
